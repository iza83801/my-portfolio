# my-portfolio
This is the source code to my first portfolio, which is a result of my learning experience in Udacity Web and Android Scholarship Programme. 
This project is one of my first into building a full porfolio. I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and had to replicate that 
design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the projects I've already 
completed throught the course of my Nanodegree program. Please note that the code written here isn't perfect. Copy at your own risk!

## How it's built
I'm sure this is a conventional way to build a portfolio. A majority of the website's page content is stored in the /data/ directory in 
MD files. I started with HTML but soon decided that Markdown would be more future proof as it could easily be ported between websites 
without much work. Further more, it allows the viewing of the content on GitHub in a pretty way.

## HTML
Nothing fancy here, just standard HTML, which is followed with programme guidelines - Porfolio Project Rubric.

## CSS
Also according to programme style guidlines.

## Bootstrap
I customized particular Boostrap framework to suit my individual project's needs. I started with the basic HTML template and then adapting 
it to suit my needs. I did the same with the css file.
## Misc
## Deployments
So far, no deployments has been done. The project is waiting for the evaluation.

## Contributing
Found a bug on my site? I will be grateful for your honest opinion. I want to point out that I am just a novice developer:)
